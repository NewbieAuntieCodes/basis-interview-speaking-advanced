XXX is a good habit to develop, so when I feel stressed, it helps me blow off some steam/take a break from study/relax/release pressure. Therefore, I will feel refreshed and focus on my work better.

示范回答 2:
As a student, I find myself stuck with a lot of homework. So XXX gives me motivations to exercise more which strengthens my health and improve quality of my life.

示范回答 3:
Playing basketball is my favourite exercise. It allows me to stretch my arms and move my body as much as possible. I even need to jump up and down to catch the ball! It's a lot of exercise but I enjoy the process a lot.`

A: I love visiting museums. I feel that I can learn much each time and it's also a great way to kill time with friends. Last month, I went to a history museum and I saw a lot of beautiful sculptures.

Q: How often do you visit museums? (思路: 提及频率，可以交代更多细节，如和谁去，去了可以干些什么)
A: Like what I said just now, I often visit museums. Almost every month, I would go to museums with my friends to spend time there, check out the latest exhibition and learn about something new.

Q: Are there any museums near where you live? (思路: 提及自己住在哪里，描述一下环境)
A: Sure, I live in the downtown area of Guangzhou. There are a lot of museums in my neighborhood. For example, we have city museums, art museums, science museums and history museums.

Q: Do you think there should be more museums near where you live? (思路: 站一边，提原因)
A: I think so. Museums are places where people can gain knowledge, expand horizons and appreciate culture and history heritage. I agree that there should be more museums.

Q: Do you think people should pay to visit museums? Or should museums be free? (思路: 批判性思维回答此问题，分析站哪一边的利弊)
A: Yes, I think we should pay to visit museums. Because it educates us to appreciate the value of history and arts. The money could be reallocated by the government for other important matters such as education, public health or transportation.`

Sending messages on the phone is very convenient. We can talk to each other anytime and anywhere. It also helps us keep the record. If we forget the details, we can just review the information on the phone easily.

Q: Do you like texting?
A1: I love texting. Actually, I always prefer texting more than calling because I feel shy and nervous when I'm talking on the phone. Texting gives me the time to think, to organize my thoughts and to choose the right words to say.
A2: I don't have patience to text, to be honest. My life is so busy. Especially when I'm at work, I don't have the time to wait for the response in texting. I'll always make a phone call, and solve the problem as soon as possible.

Q: Do you prefer sending or receiving messages?
A: I prefer a two-way communication. I don't really mind to be the one to initiate a conversation. But I need feedback as well.

Q: Have you ever received a confusing message?
A: Yes, many times actually. I remember one time, I got a text message from a stranger, asking about the time for the meeting. And I replied, sorry?

Q: In what circumstances is making a phone call better than texting?
A: Well, when you are walking or busy doing things, it's always better and safer to just make a phone call; or when you need to have a heart-to-heart conversation, making a phone call feels more intimate and sincere, and you're less likely to make a mistake; or when there's something urgent, and you want someone to give you the answer right away, it's better to just make a phone call.`
