- Education
xxx school has a good reputation in Guangzhou for its high-quality teaching, perfect teaching facilities and excellent teachers. If I am accepted by the school, it will be no doubt that I can get the best education and learn the largest amount of knowledge here.
- Explore
I can learn many new things and have new experiences by exploring the school and its surroundings. Every walk around the school campus or the neighborhood will be a new adventure. And a lot of museums, art galleries and zoo are located around the school. I can visit them whenever I want.
- Join a group
There are many clubs and after-school activities in the school. I can play in the band, join a social or political club, or find a team that is about the sport I enjoy. Group participation helps bring out my creativity and talent and develops social skills. Additionally, they are good for my emotional health as they are fun.
- Make new friends
Students in the school are from different areas and have different educational backgrounds. Studying at the school gives me the chance to reach out to other students and form friendships. We can learn from each other and get a better understanding of the different cultures.`

            example: `In my opinion, I think schools should make sure that the students do sports. Nowadays many teenagers don't like sports. It is very necessary for us to take part in sports activities. First, by doing some sports, like playing football, ping pong and so on, we can relax ourselves from concentrating for a long time in class. It's no doubt that when we get back to study, we can do better. Second, doing sports is good for our health, so we will be less likely to fall ill. Third, doing sports can help us form a new hobby, like swimming, hiking and so on. In this way, our life will be more colorful.`

Miss Zhang had a good idea to solve the problem. One day, Miss Zhang came into the classroom with some fruits, such as apples, bananas, and oranges. She said: "Today we are going to learn the names of the fruits. You can eat the fruits if you can tell me their names in English." All the students listened carefully and studied hard. Someone even stood up to answer questions. When the class was over, and the fruits were all eaten. From then on, I am more and more interested in English, and I want to say from the bottom of my heart: "Thank you, Miss Zhang!"`
